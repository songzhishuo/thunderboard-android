# ThunderBoard Mobile Application
This is the source code for the Thunderboard mobile application.



## Overview

The Silicon Labs Thunderboard app is the companion to the Thunderboard kits, which are EFR32-based development and prototyping platforms for IoT applications. This app connects with the pre-programmed firmware in the Thunderboard kits and consists of 3 different demos using on-board sensors.

- The motion demo displays a 3D render of the physical board that follows the board movements.
- The environment demo shows the value from all the on-board sensors.
- The I/O demo allows control of the LEDs and receives button state indications
